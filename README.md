# Multiple-Linear-Regression

By comparing all the four linear regression models with all predictors and based on the Backward
Elimination, Forward Selection, and Stepwise algorithms , we can say by comparing the value of
RMSE in this case the RMSE value is comparatively similar and comparing the Mean Absolute
Percentage Error of all the models which are comparatively similar such as 15.5939 and also by
checking the number of predictors for the model with all the predictors the no of predictors are 13 ,
for backward elimination the no of predictors are 11 , for Forward selection the no of predictors are
11 and for stepwise selection the no of predictors are 11 . As we need to choose the model with less
no of predictors in this case all the 3 models have the same number of predictors , now we need to
check the RMSE value which is also the same for all the 3 models . So we choose any of the
models in Backward elimination , Forward Selection and Stepwise Selection .
Here in this case as we can choose any of these Backward, Forward and Stepwise algorithms , My
first choice would be Backward elimination because of the time taken by the process for the
backward model the whole process in completed with in the 3 steps by removing the least significant
variables and also it as it removes the least important variables first by checking with highly
important variables and moderately important variables. As time taken by the process plays a major
role in the model , I choose Backward elimination as the first choice . And the Second choice is the
Forward Selection model because the forward selection model chooses the highly important
variables first and predicts the score and the final choice is the stepwise selection model.
